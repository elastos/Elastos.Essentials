## Introduction

Elastos Essentials is a multi-purpose wallet application of the Elastos ecosystem. It integrates all the services that Elastos provides such as decentralized identities (DID), storage (Hive), chains (Wallet) and combines them into a singular environment for end-users to easily use Elastos features in third party dApps.

Elastos Essentials is distributed on Android and iOS.

## dApp Developers - should you build this repo?

You don't need to build from the source. Instead, get the latest Essentials from app stores or Android daily builds from GitHub releases.

## Download Essentials for Android
[stable version](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.Essentials/releases/latest)

[the latest version(tag starting with daily)](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.Essentials/releases)

## Build from Source

### Prerequisites

Latest versions of: Git, Node.js, npm, Python, Cordova, Ionic

#### Github

- Upload your SSH public key to your GitHub profile if not already done - https://github.com/settings/keys

#### For Android:

- Java JDK 1.8 or greater
- Android SDK
- Android NDK (android-ndk-r16b or higher)

 The supported way of doing this nowadays is to use Android Studio.

 Set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to match the Android SDK path.

 on Mac and Linux, add the following line to your login script (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, etc...):

 ```
 export ANDROID_HOME="YOUR-PATH/sdk"
 ```

 On Windows, set the environment variable in the control panel.

#### For iOS:
- Xcode 12

### Get the Code

```sh
cd <YOUR_PATH>
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:elastos/Elastos.Essentials.git
cd Elastos.Essentials
```

Hold on, this will take a while.

### Build on Mac OS, Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Hosts

**For a fresh start or restart:**

```shell
./synccode.sh
./ToolChains/bin/build clobber
./ToolChains/bin/build all
```

This will build the android platform only. To build ios:

```
./ToolChains/bin/build all -pf ios
```

**Depending on what you are working on (runtime, plugins, dapps...)**:

Check **build script options** below.

### Build script options

- build clean: deletes runtime platforms.

    If you update plugins, you should call build clean, then build runtime. Otherwise, the latest plugin changes are not applied inside the native app.

- build clobber: deletes all generated or downloaded files (everything).

- build runtime: builds runtime module.
- build launcher: builds launcher and runtime module.
- build all: builds all modules, include runtime, launcher and dapps.

- build plugin -p plugin_path: reinstalls the specified plugin.

NOTEï¼šYou can type `./ToolChains/bin/build --help` for more details.

**build all** takes time, so it is advised to build the relevant target only.


### Build on Windows Host

```shell
python ToolChains\bin\build all
```

**Build and run the Android platform in Android Studio:**

- From Android Studio, import the project from `Elastos.Essentials/App/platforms/android`
- Run the project

**Using Xcode:**

- Open the xcworkspace from `Elastos.Essentials/App/platforms/ios`
- Run the project

### To update the existing folder to the latest source code

From the root Elastos.Essentials folder, run the following command to update all submodules to master:

```shell
./synccode.sh
```

Then build what you need to work on. Choose among:

```shell
./ToolChains/bin/build runtime
./ToolChains/bin/build plugin -p Plugins/MyPlugin
./ToolChains/bin/build dapp ...
```
